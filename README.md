# Student_Record_Portal
This is a project-based on Python. The GUI for the application has been developed using PyQt5.

The project aims to provide a Desktop portal to help enter records for a student and store them in the form of an SQLite database file.

The file "main.py" contains the main code of the project. It enables the user to enter the username and password for verification. The input fields are checked with the data from the table "users" present in the "students.db" file. The main portal also contains a link which takes the user to this repository.

The next file "submit.py" contains the code for the Window to enter and update the student records in the main database file. The input data is stored in the "records" table of the "students.db" database file.

Screenshots of the outputs can also be found in the files section of the repository.
